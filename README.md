  To use this application it is fairly easy.  Simply navigate to the link provided in the repo and at the end of this section.  Once there please click the "Get Started" button.  This will take you to the notes page itself. From there you can click on "Note Title" and enter your text, and do the same for "Note Text".  Then click "Save Note" in the top right of the screen and your note will be saved.  You can delete the note using the little red trash icon next to the note title.
